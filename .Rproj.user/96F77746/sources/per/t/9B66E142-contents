This package constitutes an interactive R problem set based on the RTutor package (https://github.com/skranz/RTutor). 


The problem set is based on the paper "Credit, Attention, and Externalities in the Adoption of Energy Efficient Technologies by Low-Income Households" by Berkouwer and Dean (2022). 

Under the following link, you can find the paper and the corresponding data: https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20210766

In this interactive problem set, various analyses are carried out to investigate the benefits of an energy-efficient stove. In addition, strategies are explored that lead to an increased adaption of this climate-friendly cooker.

## 1. Installation

RTutor and this package is hosted on Github. To install everything, run the following code in your R console.
```s
install.packages("RTutor",repos = c("https://skranz-repo.github.io/drat/",getOption("repos")))

if (!require(devtools))
  install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("jannaeisenhut/RTutorEnergyEfficience")
```

## 2. Show and work on the problem set
To start the problem set first create a working directory in which files like the data sets and your solution will be stored. Then adapt and run the following code.
```s
library(RTutorEnergyEfficience)

# Adapt your working directory to an existing folder
setwd("C:/problemsets/RTutorEnergyEfficience")
# Adapt your user name
run.ps(user.name="Jon Doe", package="RTutorEnergyEfficience",
       auto.save.code=TRUE, clear.user=FALSE)
```
If everything works fine, a browser window should open, in which you can start exploring the problem set.
